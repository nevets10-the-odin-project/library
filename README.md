# library
Library project from the Full Stack JavaScript path

## Post project reflection
This project was pretty straight forward. Since it was primarily tied to using constructors, I'm going to call the interface good enough for now.

Update: The book constructor has been refactored to use class as per https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-classes
