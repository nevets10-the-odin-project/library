# Project: Library

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

Live example: https://nevets10-the-odin-project.github.io/library/

## Introduction

Let’s extend the ‘Book’ example from the [previous lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-objects-and-object-constructors#exercise) and turn it into a small Library app.

## Post project reflection
This project was pretty straight forward. Since it was primarily tied to using constructors, I'm going to call the interface good enough for now.

Update: The book constructor has been refactored to use class as per https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-classes
